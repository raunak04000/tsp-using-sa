# tsp-using-sa
This C++ program solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simulated Annealing (SA). Starting with a random tour, neighbor solutions are generated by swapping two cities. Lower-cost solutions are accepted, while higher-cost ones are accepted probabilistically. SA runs for 10,000 iterations to find an optimal tour.
